            <title><![CDATA[Origin Of The Word Bastard]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Origin Of The Word Bastard</h1>,<p>Believed to have come from the old Frankish language, Bastarðr means conceived on the saddle (when used as a pillow whilst travelling) and basing means born or conceived in the barn. These are also related to proto-Germanic 'báss' (which reminds one of Shakespeare's "Why brand they us with base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?"). There is also Gothic Bansts, or modern boose (cattle crib).</p>]]></description>

The name was contrived as a tongue-in-cheek gibe aimed at the great number of social clubs who thrived on rituals, exclusivity, and pretentious activities.</p>,<p>They had meetings, they had fun, and in the end they died out. There are a few of them left, I suppose, but I have lost contact with them. It seems a shame that they did not expand their activities, for in a world that is sadly lacking in humour and basic values, they would fill a need in a social pattern that cannot laugh at itself.</p>]]></description>
