# Origin Of The Word Bastard

Believed to have come from the old Frankish language, Bastarðr means conceived on the saddle (when used as a pillow whilst travelling) and basing means born or conceived in the barn. These are also related to proto-Germanic 'báss' (which reminds one of Shakespeare's "Why brand they us with base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?"). There is also Gothic Bansts, or modern boose (cattle crib).

Depending upon the case, the word bastard has wrongfully fallen into use as an epithet. It is in fact a simple descriptive term. Historically it is the word used to describe children born out of wedlock. During the middle ages and the age of chivalry, men (Nobles) went about the country fighting, robbing, collecting taxes and generally causing mayhem. At days end they were exhausted from their endeavours and so they would call a truce with any local peasants and arrange to sleep in their barn. The peasant girls, curious as to the noble physique, would happily join the traveller on his saddle /pillow.

Shunned by the noble fathers and held in awe by the peasant mothers, the issue of these social experiments spent their lives fighting for their birth-wrights. Some fought their way to recognition, highly esteemed by the military, they earned a reputation as a force to be reckoned with.

Their legitimate siblings, possessively jealous of the family estates, saw these bastards as a threat to their personal inheritance and fought vigorously to deprive them of their birth right. Notwithstanding this opposition some of them were accepted by their fathers and became important members of their families estates, usually as the leader of their troops.

When the middle age armourers designed a superior sword as the main side arm of troops they named it the Bastard Sword. They did this in homage to the fighting spirit and the fighting strength of the children fathered on the saddle or in the barn. Circumstances ruled that the bastards would be in for a very tough life and thus grow up to be hardy. And so it was that every European army depended on their hardy bastard swords for centuries, only replacing them with the advent of a good working pistol.
